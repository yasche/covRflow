Description: Retrieve album covers from a web Application Programming Interface (API) and use them to create a cover flow in the viewer pane. Currently only the Discogs API <https://www.discogs.com/developers/#> is supported. Honestly just an excuse to play around with the Discogs API and the Viewer pane.
