Version: 0.0.0.9000
Authors@R: 
    person("Yannik", "Schermer", , "mail@yannik.science", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Retrieve music cover artworks from a web Application Programming Interface (API) and use them to create an interactive display in the Viewer pane in the style of the famous cover flow. Currently only the 'Discogs' API <https://www.discogs.com/developers/#> is supported. Honestly just an excuse to play around with the 'Discogs' API and the Viewer pane.
